### Hi there, I'm Adrian ðŸ‘‹

With 10 years of experience in UI design and web application development, my expertise spans both design and coding. While possessing a broad skill set, my primary focus lies in Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP. Over the years, numerous MVPs and products have been designed and built from scratch under my guidance, always adhering to conventions and best practices.
